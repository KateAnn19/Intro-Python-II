Along the way you will meet lots of friendly and not so friendly creatures. Some will help you and and some will try to steer you away from the treasure. You can also collect items as you go to feed the bad creatures and make them fall into the pit. Good luck. May Fortune ðŸ’° be with you {player1.name}.")

# Write a loop that:
#
# * Prints the current room name
# * Prints the current description (the textwrap module might be useful here).
# * Waits for user input and decides what to do.
#
# If the user enters a cardinal direction, attempt to move to the room there.
# Print an error message if the movement isn't allowed.
#
# If the user enters "q", quit the game.
